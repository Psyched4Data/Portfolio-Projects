# About This Project
R is a great language for both statistical analysis and visualization. 
I use the "iris" data set built in RStudio to show data exploration, statistical analysis, and visualization. 
All work is contained in an [HTML R Markdown file](https://github.com/Psyched4Data/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Iris%20Data%20Analysis%20in%20R/Markdown-Iris-Data-Analysis.html).
