# About This Project
This project utilizes survey data collected from individuals who work in the data field. 
The survey data was cleaned in Power Query to simplify the "Other" responses, then a dashboard was created using Microsoft Power BI. Responses in the "Other" column were not standardized and had too many categories so the data was simplified.
[Analyst Survey Results](https://github.com/Psyched4Data/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Analyst%20Survey%20Power%20BI/Analyst%20Survey%20Results.xlsx) shows the data set used to generate the Dashboard.
