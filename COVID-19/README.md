# About This Project
In this project I take a data set from "Our World in Data" that describes global COVID-19 figures. 
I take the raw CSV file, clean the date entries, use formulas to create a rolling count of people vaccinated over time, 
and lastly I use Tableau to create visualizations based on the SQL queries.
