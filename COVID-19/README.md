# About This Project
In this project, I take a data set from "Our World in Data" that describes global COVID-19 figures. 
I take the raw CSV file, clean the date entries, use formulas to create a rolling count of people vaccinated over time, 
and lastly I use Tableau to create visualizations based on the SQL queries. Unfortunately, not all of the data was 
uploaded onto MySQL and so this led to limitations on the data that could be displayed in Tableau.
